## Introduction 
This is a training project which was created in order to develop my programming skills. This is a web scraping application, that reads job offers and their details from
job site "indeed.com" and writes them into Excel file. The user enters the position and workplace of interest, and the program searches for it in the firefox browser on "indeed.com" site. Then it reads the first 5 pages of the search results and writes collected data into Excel file.
